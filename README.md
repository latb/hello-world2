# hello-world2
another year another hello-world tutorial
this is step 3 making and committing changes. I did it wrong the first time, as usual - to literal when following instructions :)
however, I do seem to remember how to clone a remote repository and make chanes so far.
we will see about committing and pushing to github, next.
but first, remember to change directors (cd) to the cloned repository (in this case hello)
and do git status to make sure it worked
